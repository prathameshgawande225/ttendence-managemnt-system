 General Project Showcase
📘 Built a simple yet effective Attendance Management System in C!
✍️ Features: Add students, mark attendance, generate reports, and identify defaulters — all in one console-based interface.
🧠 Learned file handling, structs, and control flow deeply through this.
🚀 Next step: adding persistence & date-wise tracking!

🔷 Technical Highlight (File Handling)
💾 "Save it or lose it!"
Implemented basic file I/O in C to store attendance records permanently.
fopen, fprintf, and fclose are the real MVPs here!
✅ Logs every student's presence across sessions — no more data loss

🔷 Debug & Learn Moment
🔍 Caught a sneaky bug in my attendance system today!
Used close(file); instead of fclose(file); — a reminder that even small typos can break a program.
🛠 Debugging is just as important as coding.

🔷 Structs in Action
📦 Used struct to manage student records in C.
Roll number, name, present count, total classes — all grouped for easy access and modification.
Structs make managing complex data so much cleaner in low-level languages.

🔷 Professional Growth
🚀 Small projects, big learning!
My latest console-based C project: a mini Attendance Tracker with defaulter list generation.
Learned the value of planning logic, user input handling, and maintaining clean code.
Always amazed at what’s possible with foundational C knowledge.
